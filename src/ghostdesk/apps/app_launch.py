    """Start a GUI application in the background.

    Only executables listed by ``app_list()`` are accepted. The process
    runs detached; its stdout and stderr are captured to
    ``/tmp/ghostdesk/proc-<pid>.log`` and can be tailed with
    ``app_status(pid)``.

    Before calling this, check ``app_running()`` (or take a screenshot)
    — the target may already be open, in which case
    ``key_press("alt+tab")`` or clicking its taskbar entry is faster
    than launching a second instance and avoids doubling memory use.

    After a successful launch, the window usually needs a second or two
    to paint. Take a fresh screenshot before interacting with it.

    Returns a dict with:
    - pid: the process ID of the launched application.
    - log_file: path to the file capturing stdout and stderr.
    - action: description of what was launched.

    On failure, returns a dict with a single ``error`` key describing
    what went wrong (not a GUI app, invalid syntax, command not found).
