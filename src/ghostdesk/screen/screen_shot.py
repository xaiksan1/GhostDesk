    This is the agent's only source of truth. Coordinates used in any
    subsequent mouse call are pixel offsets in the image this function
    returned — the moment anything changes on screen, those coordinates
    become stale and must be recomputed from a fresh capture.

    Cheap. Use liberally: before a click to locate the target, after an
    action to verify the effect, and once more before reporting a
    mission complete.

    Args:
        region: Area to capture as ``(x, y, width, height)``. Omit to
            capture the full screen — almost always the right choice.
        format: ``"webp"`` (default, small payload, visually stable at
            UI resolutions) or ``"png"`` (lossless, larger).
        stabilize: When true (default), wait up to 2.5 s for two
            consecutive frames to be identical before returning — catches
            pages still animating after a click or navigation. Set to
            false only when you need to observe a genuinely animating UI
            in motion.
        quality: WebP encoder quality 1-100. Default ``50`` — visually
            indistinguishable from ``80`` on typical UI content (text on
            solid backgrounds, buttons, menus) but roughly half the
            encoded bytes. Raise to ``80+`` when you need to read fine
            pixels (small fonts in a PDF, design mockups, photo content).
            Ignored when ``format="png"``.
